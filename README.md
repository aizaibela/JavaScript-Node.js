# JavaScript-Node.js

This is a generic test applied to all candidates to JavaScript or Node.js jobs.

Being generic means that developers in all levels do the same test, but our analysis will be different depending on the job vacancy that you applied for.

The test is composed of 4 challenges. Each one is the evolution of the previous.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Overview
Your team is assigned to build an ETL (Extract, Transform and Load) that will be used for Big Data analysis.

You'll be responsible to build the Transform part of the ETL. You have 4 samples of data to be transformed. Each of samples some new elements that made harder to transform than the previous.

Your goal is to evolve your code, starting at the first sample until the last one, or until you are capable of doing. Even you evolving the same code, remember to save separately

Basicaly, you need to code a JavaScript ES6 Class that receive a string (the level's sample) and return a collection (array of objects)
